* Objects: Objects represent a real-world entity and the basic building block of OOP
* Class: Class is the prototype or blueprint of an object.
  
#### Four principle of object-oriented programming
  * encapsulation: encapsultion is the mechanism of binding the data together and hinding it from outside world.
  * Abstraction: abstraction can be thought of as the natural extension of encapsulation.
  * Inheritance: inheritance is the mechanism of creating new classes from existing ones.
  * Polymorphism: the ability of an object to take different forms and thus, depending upon the context, to respond to the same message in different ways.
