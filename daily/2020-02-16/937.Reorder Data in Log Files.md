### 937. Reorder Data in Log Files

* Actually this is a bit difficult for me

```
class Solution:
   def reorderLogFiles(self, logs: List[str])
        def f(log):
            id_, rest = log.split(" ", 1)
            return (0, rest, id_) if rest[0].isalpha() else (1, )
        return sorted(logs, key=f)
```

* The solution is very good!!
